ps://github.com/winstonjs/winston/commit/8cd8368) Change the method signature to a `filter` function to be consistent with `rewriter` and log functions:**
``` js
function filter (level, msg, meta, inst) {
  // Filter logic goes here...
}
```

**Other breaking changes**
- [e0c9dde](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/commit/e0c9dde) Remove `winston.transports.Webhook`. Use `winston.transports.Http` instead.
- [f71e638](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/commit/f71e638) Remove `Logger.prototype.addRewriter` and `Logger.prototype.addFilter` since they just push to an Array of functions. Use `logger.filters.push` or `logger.rewriters.push` explicitly instead.
- [a470ab5](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/commit/a470ab5) No longer respect the `handleExceptions` option to `new winston.Logger`. Instead just pass in the `exceptionHandlers` option itself.
- [8cb7048](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/commit/8cb7048) Removed `Logger.prototype.extend` functionality

#### New features
- [3aa990c](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/commit/3aa990c) Added `Logger.prototype.configure` which now contains all logic previously in the `winston.Logger` constructor function. (`indexzero`)

- [#700](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston/pull/700) Add an `eol` option to the `Console` transport. (`aquavitae`)

#### Fixes, refactoring, and optimizations. OH MY!
